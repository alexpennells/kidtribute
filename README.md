The easiest way to host the website is to run

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

in the directory containing the html pages. This will open a basic webserver in that directory and allow for storage of cookies.

The website will then be available at http://localhost:8000

This has been tested with Chrome v30 (but all recent versions should work)
